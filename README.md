# Moisture-Guard-AI-IoT
Arduino/Tinkercad smart irrigation system: reads soil moisture, shows live status on a 16x2 LCD, and simulates auto-watering via servo valve + buzzer with a state machine (WET/NORMAL/DRY/WATERING/COOLDOWN). Logs CSV telemetry and includes a Colab notebook that predicts time-to-dry (30% trigger)
